Learning new things has never been so much fun for me. When I asked myself why, I realized that the answer was to learn Data Science at Clarusway .

I have been learning Data Science at Clarusway for 6 months. I have completed a data analysis project which is the Credit Score Friendly Exploratory Data Analysis project and I am very happy to share my project.

I am very grateful to the Clarusway family for their endless support and encouragement.

In this project, credit score classification data on keagle was recognized and understood firstly . A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was also performed using the python numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Finally, the cleaned data was prepared to implement Machine Learning Algorithms.

The project consists of two parts.
